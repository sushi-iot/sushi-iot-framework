**Sourcing**  
All boards that mount WROVER SoC are ok.  
The official ESP32DevKitC module coding define these as "VE" (PCB antenna) or "VIE" (external antenna) both mount WROVER.
Please note that modules with cheaper WROOM modules **can not** be used since these SoC do not has the external 4/8M.
