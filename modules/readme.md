This folder contains the *frozen* modules, these are classic ".py" modules embedded into Sushi-IoT-Framework firmware.
It's possible extend/edit these modules just loading the modified .py file into MicroPython file system, in this way the frozen version will be replaced by the ones save into the disk.
