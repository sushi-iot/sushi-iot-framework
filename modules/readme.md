This folder contains the *frozen* modules, these are classic ".py" modules embedded into Sushi-IoT-Framework firmware.
It's possible extend/edit these modules just loading the modified .py file into MicroPython file system.  
Just use a a different name to do not create conflicts with the frozen ones.
