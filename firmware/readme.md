## **Supported Boards**  

Sushi-IoT-Framework can run on microcontroller boards based on ESP32 SoC.  
There are many different ESP32 SoC variants, to start from somewhere the 1st version of Sushi-IoT-Framework support the WROVER model (the one with extra 4MB SPI-RAM).  

Board name | Description | ESP32 Chip |
|---|---|---|
[Sushi-IoT-Board](https://sushi-iot.github.io/sushi-iot-board/) | The Sushi board is the "official" but **not mandatory** board, based on ESP32DevKitC-V4, created to support the Sushi-IoT-Framework project. This board uses an ESP32DevKitC-V4 module. | WROVER SoC - 4/8MB Flash - 4MB PSRAM |
[ESP32DevKitC-V4](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32/esp32-devkitc/user_guide.html) | Official development board from Espressif, the ESP32 producer. | WROVER SoC - 4/8MB Flash - 4MB PSRAM |
Generic ESP32-WROVER board | Any board using a compatible WROVER SoC can possibly be used. | WROVER SoC - 4/8MB Flash - 4MB PSRAM |

**If you do not have any specific compatible board you can still use Sushi-IoT-Framework for a generic board matching the ESP32 SoC chip on it.**
